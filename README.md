# PriorityQueue

//  this file creates objects of the type 'Priority_queue'.
//  These objects are priority queues or heaps that contain key and 
//  data-value pairs. A variety of functions are then called on these 
//  trees to add items to the queue, increase or decrease the value of 
//  an item, to show the heap, and finally a visual print to show the 
//  branching.
